    <h2>Difference between &lt;div&gt; and &lt;Semantic Elements&gt;</h2>
   
    <!-- Mainly to show difference in replacing semantic elements 
     this div and span code been added. -->

    <!-- <div> 
        This is a <strong>div</strong> element . Here it takes up a full width 
        of the webpage.
    </div> -->

        <!-- Block level elements using Semantic tags instead of div-->

    <section>
        This is a <strong>Section</strong> element. Unlike a dev, it takes up a full width of the 
        webpage , but it will also give meaning that this is a group content to make developers or users 
        understandable. 
    </section>

 <!-- <p> 
        This is a paragraph
        <span style="color:red">
            Unlike div, span takes only that part text
             content as width and stays as inline
        </span>
    </p> -->

<!-- Inline level elements using Semantic tags instead of span -->

    <p> 
        This is a paragraph
        <em style="color:red">
            Unlike section/div, <em>emphasis</em> or <mark>hightlight</mark> takes only that
             part text content as width and stays as inline
        </em>
    </p>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Why semantic elements is better ?  -->
 
<!-- Compare of div, Section tells the browsers, screen readers and for SEO that this is a group block of 
related content and more readable for developers.

Compare to span, em is used for screen readers, mark indicates the highlighted text, Strong used to tells
browser that this word given importance with bold font.  -->
